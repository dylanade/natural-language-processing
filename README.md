# Natural Language Processing Projects

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, assignments, and experimental projects. These projects explore a range of NLP tasks, from machine translation to sentiment analysis.

## Projects Included

- **Character-Level Machine Translation**  
  A sequence-to-sequence model for translating text at the character level.

- **Fake News Detection**  
  A text classification model to distinguish between real and fake news articles.

- **Inference on User Input**  
  A model pipeline that processes and infers meaning or intent from user-provided text.

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
  An implementation for tagging tokens in a sentence with their respective POS labels.

- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  A classifier to determine the sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) of input text.

- **Spelling Autocorrector**  
  A model that automatically corrects misspelled words based on contextual and dictionary-based methods.

## Tools & Technologies
